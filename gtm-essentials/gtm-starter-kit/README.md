# GTM Starter Kit

A ready-to-import Google Tag Manager container that stands up a baseline of
form-submit conversion tracking for **GA4** and **Meta**, built on top of the
[GTM Essentials](../) variables. Import it into a fresh (or
existing) web container to get the tags, trigger, and variables below.

## Quick import

1. GTM → **Admin → Import Container**.
2. Choose `gtm-starter-kit.json`, select your workspace.
3. Pick **Merge** and **Rename conflicting** so nothing existing is overwritten.
4. Preview, then Confirm.

Placeholder account/container IDs (`0`) are remapped into whatever container you
import into. Everything lands in two folders: **GTM Starter Kit** (the tags,
trigger, and new variables) and **GTM Essentials** (the shared variables).

**Before it works, do these three things** (see [Setup](#setup-after-import)):
set your GA4 Measurement ID, make sure the Meta Pixel base is loaded, and make
sure your forms fire GTM's built-in `gtm.formSubmit` event.

## What it creates

### Tags — folder *GTM Starter Kit*

| Tag | Type | Fires on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Configuration - GA4** | Google tag | Initialization - All Pages | Tag ID = `{{GA4 - Measurement ID}}`. |
| **GA4 - Event - Form Submit** | GA4 Event | `gtm.formSubmit` | Event name `ga4e_form_submit`, Measurement ID `{{GA4 - Measurement ID}}`, **Once per event**. Parameters below. |
| **Meta - Event - Lead - Form Submit** | Custom HTML | `gtm.formSubmit` | Fires `fbq('track', 'Lead', …)` with page path / traffic source / ad placement, plus `eventID: {{cJS - Custom Event ID}}` for browser/server dedupe. |
| **Conversion Linker** | Conversion Linker | All Pages | Improves Google Ads click-ID cookie durability. |

**GA4 - Event - Form Submit → event parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| `cjs_traffic_source` | `{{cJS - Traffic Source}}` |
| `cjs_ad_placement` | `{{cJS - Ad Placement}}` |

### Trigger — folder *GTM Starter Kit*

- **gtm.formSubmit** — Form Submission (GTM's built-in form listener; fires on
  every `gtm.formSubmit` event, i.e. any native HTML form submit). *Wait for
  Tags* and *Check Validation* are both off. Drives both the GA4 event and Meta
  tags.

### Variables — folder *GTM Starter Kit*

- **GA4 - Measurement ID** — Constant, `G-0000000000`. **Replace with your real
  Measurement ID** — every GA4 tag reads from this one place.

> **User-Provided Data variable — add this one by hand.** GTM's User-Provided
> Data variable has no stable container-export type, so it isn't in the JSON.
> Add it after import: **Variables → New → Variable Configuration →
> User-Provided Data**, set it to **Automatic**, and name it `User Provided
> Data`. It's a two-click add and pairs with GA4 / Google Ads enhanced
> conversions.

### Built-in variables enabled

Element / ID / Target / Text / URL, HTML ID, Page Hostname / Path / URL,

## Included from GTM Essentials

These variables come from the [**GTM Essentials**](../) toolkit
entry and are bundled here (folder *GTM Essentials*) so the kit is self-contained.
Full details and source files are in
[`gtm-essentials/README.md`](../README.md).

> **Maintenance — keep this in sync with GTM Essentials.** The variables below
> are **copies** baked into `gtm-starter-kit.json`. Whenever GTM Essentials gains
> or changes a variable, refresh this export too so the copies don't drift. (A
> `.json` file can't carry an inline comment, so this reminder lives here.)

- **First-party cookie variables** (`1PC - …`): `_fbc`, `_fbp`, `fbclid`,
  `_gcl_aw`, `_uetmsclkid`, `_ttp`, `_twclid`, `li_fat_id`.
- **`cJS - Traffic Source`** — last-touch traffic source
  ([source](../variables/cjs-traffic-source/cjs-traffic-source.js)).
- **`cJS - Ad Placement`** — `utm_placement`, persisted per session
  ([source](../variables/cjs-ad-placement/ad-placement.js)).
- **`DLV - gtm.uniqueEventId`** — GTM's built-in page-local event counter;
  cache key for the variable below.
- **`cJS - Custom Event ID`** — globally unique event ID for Meta Pixel /
  CAPI deduplication, cached per `{{DLV - gtm.uniqueEventId}}`
  ([source](../variables/cjs-custom-event-id/cjs-custom-event-id.js)).
- **`cJS - Page Title`**, **`cJS - Post Title`**, **`cJS - Post ID`**,
  **`cJS - Form ID`** — page/post/form context
  ([sources](../variables/)).

## Setup after import

1. **GA4 - Measurement ID** → set the Constant to your `G-XXXXXXXXXX`.
2. **Meta Pixel base** must load before *Meta - Event - Lead - Form Submit*
   (the tag calls `fbq(...)`, so `fbq` has to exist). Add your Pixel base tag,
   ideally gated on consent.
3. **`gtm.formSubmit` event** must fire for your forms. The *gtm.formSubmit*
   Form Submission trigger enables GTM's built-in listener, which catches
   native HTML `<form>` submits. Forms that submit via AJAX/JavaScript without
   a native submit event (Elementor, GHL, Wix, etc.) won't trigger it — for
   those, install the platform listener from this toolkit (e.g. the
   [Elementor Listener](../../wordpress/elementor/elementor-listener-form-submit/))
   and point the tags at a Custom Event trigger for its dataLayer event
   instead.

## Things to verify on import

- **GA4 event Measurement ID** — confirm the tag's Measurement ID field resolves
  to `{{GA4 - Measurement ID}}` (or point it at the *Configuration - GA4* Google tag).
- **User-Provided Data** — not in the JSON (see above); add it via the UI.
- **Trigger mapping** — *Configuration - GA4* should fire on **Initialization - All
  Pages** and *Conversion Linker* on **All Pages**; re-select if either didn't
  map.

## Suggestions

- **Firing option:** every tag ships set to *Once per event* (Advanced Settings
  → Tag firing options), so each trigger event fires the tag at most once —
  including repeat form submits on the same page load.
- **Consent:** for Consent Mode setups, fire *Conversion Linker* on **Consent
  Initialization - All Pages**, and gate the Meta tag on marketing consent.
